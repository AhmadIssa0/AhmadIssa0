Hi, I'm Ahmad Issa, a postdoc with a Mathematics PhD interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Welcome to my Github!

<!---
Fun facts about me:
- The last programming language I learnt was the multi-paradigm language Scala. It has changed the way I think about programming.
- I've programmed in very many different programming languages (some rather esoteric). As an example, [here's](https://github.com/AhmadIssa0/JSudokuSolver) a short (225 character) sudoku solver I wrote for fun in the somewhat esoteric [J programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)).
- I love solving problems which combine math and programming. At some point in highschool I was ranked 3 out of all users on the popular site [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
